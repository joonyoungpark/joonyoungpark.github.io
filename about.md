<h1>Hi, I'm Joon.</h1>

<h2>TL;DR</h2>

I’m a first year biomedical engineering student at University of Waterloo.
I’m taking all of the data analysis, statistics, and machine learning skills 
I’ve learned (and continue to learn) and now applying them to awesome side projects.
**Currently back in South Korea to serve in the military.**

<h2>The Long Version</h2>

I’ve always loved design, invention, and innovation. 
My natural curiosity, love of people-oriented projects, and the interdisciplinary nature led me into 
choosing the major biomedical engineering. 
During my first co-op placement, it was my first time being exposed to the field of data science, machine learning, and web development.
Working on those subjects was an enjoyable experience and I am planning to weave the skills I've learned into humanistic components.

In other words, I decided to pursue the software side of biomedical engineering. I’ve been taking lots of online tutorials, working on lots of personal projects, 
joining local Meetups, and looking for future co-op jobs in the field.
I’m always looking for new people to chat with and new problems to solve, so feel free to reach out to me!
